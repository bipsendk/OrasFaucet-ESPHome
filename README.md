ESPHome BLE Proxy - with code to connect to ORAS 6150FZ Bluetooth faucet (https://www.oras.com/en/design-lines/oras/washbasin-faucet/6150FZ)

You will have to modify the MAC address of the faucet in the ble_client section.

Please observe: The MAC may change on battery replacement

Also, the service and capabilities uuid's might be different/randomly generated. I do not have multiple faucets, som I have not been able to verify it.
